# WIP

The Python interface for ACTIONet is currently a work-in progress. Though it is installable in its current state, the code is being actively updated and things may break.

### TODO

- [x] ~~Initial end-to-end matching R example run (up to `run.ACTIONet`)~~
- [ ] Reorganize source directories to match usage
- [ ] Unify slot names with AnnData object exported from R
- [ ] Fix inconsistency with `build_network` in Python and `build_ACTIONet` in R
- [ ] Unify function names with R if needed
- [ ] Implement secondary functions from R (such as filtering, normalization, annotation)
- [ ] Implement visualization
